#Welcome

The Qi Client samples are introductory, language-specific examples of programming against the Qi storage service..  They are intended as instructional samples only.  

#Sample Pattern

All the samples are console applications that follow the same sequence of events, allowing you to select the langauge with which you are most comfortable without missing any instructional features.  The pattern is:

1. Instantiate a Qi REST client
2. Obtain an authentication token
3. Create a Qi type to represent the data being stored
4. Create a Qi stream to store event data in
5. Create and insert events into the stream
6. Retrieve events for a specified range
7. Update events
8. Delete events

These steps illustrate the fundamental programming steps of Qi.  Over time, we will extend the sample to demonstrate more advanced tasks.  Feel free to modify the samples and propose changes.
