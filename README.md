# OSIsoft Samples
([OSIsoft](https://www.osisoft.com/)) is a proven leader in enabling operation intelligence.  In this GitHub repo, we provide samples which will help you get started with using OSIsoft technology. The repo includes samples against the [PI Server](https://www.osisoft.com/pi-system/) via PI Web API (COMING SOON), samples using OSIsoft Cloud Services ([OCS](https://cloud.osisoft.com/welcome)) via the OCS API directly and using libraries, and samples creating OSIsoft Message Format ([OMF](https://pisquare.osisoft.com/community/developers-club/omf)) messages and sending them.  The samples are intended to help you get started and are not production applications and libraries.


The official OSIsoft samples are organized by technology and accessible through the following table:

Technology|Description
----|-----------
**<a href="ocs_samples/">OCS</a>** | These samples cover programming against OCS.  Samples include basic samples to more advanced.  <a href="ocs_samples/">Details</a>  
**<a href="omf_samples/">OMF</a>** | These samples highlight forming and sending OMF messages for PI and OCS.  <a href="omf_samples/">Details</a>  
**<a href="piwebapi_samples/">PI Web API</a>**  | These samples cover programming against the PI Server via the PI Web API. <a href="piwebapi_samples/">Details</a>  

Note: The OMF samples work against both the on-prem PI System and OCS.
