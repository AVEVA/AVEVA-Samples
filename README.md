# OSIsoft Samples

([AVEVA](https://www.aveva.com/)) is a proven leader in enabling operation intelligence. In this GitHub repo, we provide samples which will help you get started with using AVEVA technology. The repo includes samples against the [PI Server](https://www.aveva.com/en/products/pi-system/) via PI Web API, samples using AVEVA Data Hub ([Data Hub](https://datahub.connect.aveva.com)) via the Data Hub APIs directly and using libraries, and samples creating Open Message Format ([OMF](https://docs.osisoft.com/bundle/data-hub/page/add-organize-data/collect-data/connectors/omf/omf-overview.html)) messages and sending them. The samples are intended to help you get started and are not production applications and libraries.

The official AVEVA samples are organized by technology and accessible through the following table:
