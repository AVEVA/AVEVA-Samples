# OSIsoft Samples

([OSIsoft](https://www.osisoft.com/)) is a proven leader in enabling operation intelligence. In this GitHub repo, we provide samples which will help you get started with using OSIsoft technology. The repo includes samples against the [PI Server](https://www.osisoft.com/pi-system/) via PI Web API, samples using AVEVA Data Hub ([Data Hub](https://datahub.connect.aveva.com)) via the Data Hub API directly and using libraries, and samples creating OSIsoft Message Format ([OMF](https://pisquare.osisoft.com/community/developers-club/omf)) messages and sending them. The samples are intended to help you get started and are not production applications and libraries.

The official OSIsoft samples are organized by technology and accessible through the following table:

**Note:** these samples have transitioned to be hosted in seperate repositories based on their technology.
