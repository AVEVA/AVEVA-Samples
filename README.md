# OSIsoft Samples
([OSIsoft](https://www.osisoft.com/)) is a proven leader in enabling operation intelligence.  In this GitHub repo, we provide samples which will help you get started with using OSIsoft technology. The repo includes examples against the [PI Server](https://www.osisoft.com/pi-system/) via PI Web API, OSIsoft Cloud Services ([OCS](https://cloud.osisoft.com/welcome)) via the OCS API and nuget library, and OSIsoft Message Format ([OMF](https://pisquare.osisoft.com/community/developers-club/omf))



The official OSIsoft samples are organized by which technology they connect to and use, accessible through the following table:
