A custom managed agent hosted on our domain is used for on-prem testing.  A PI-WebAPI endpoint exposed to the general internet using properly configured security (both PI and computer) and a microsoft hosted agent would also work.

This document serves as notice for what is currently installed on the test agent for on-prem testing.  Typically the only things that need to be installed are what is mentioned in the respective readme files, so this list shouldn't matter.   However, in the case you have that installed and it is not working, here is what is installed on the test agents.
