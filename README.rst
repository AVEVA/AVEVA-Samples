The Qi Client samples are introductory, language-specific examples of programming against the Qi Service. They are intended as instructional samples only.

Sample Pattern
--------------

All basic samples are console applications that follow the same sequence of events, allowing you to select the langauge with which you are most comfortable without missing any instructional features. The pattern followed is:

1.  Instantiate a Qi client
2.  Obtain an authentication token
3.  Create a QiType to represent the data being stored
4.  Create a QiStream to store event data in
5.  Create and insert events into the stream
6.  Retrieve events for a specified range
7.  Update events
8.  Replace events
9.  Demonstrate QiStreamBehaviors
10. Use QiViews and QiViewMaps
11. Delete events
12. Delete metadata objects

These steps illustrate the fundamental programming steps of Qi. Over time, the samples may be extended to demonstrate more advanced tasks. Feel free to modify the samples and propose changes.
