The Qi Client samples are introductory, language-specific examples of programming against the Qi Service. They are intended as instructional samples only.

Sample Pattern
--------------

All basic samples are console applications that follow the same sequence of events, allowing you to select the langauge with which you are most comfortable without missing any instructional features. The pattern followed is:

Instantiate a Qi client
Obtain an authentication token
Create a QiType to represent the data being stored
Create a QiStream to store event data in
Create and insert events into the stream
Retrieve events for a specified range
Update events
Replace events
Demonstrate QiStreamBehaviors
Use QiViews and QiViewMaps
Delete events
Delete metadata objects
These steps illustrate the fundamental programming steps of Qi. Over time, the samples may be extended to demonstrate more advanced tasks. Feel free to modify the samples and propose changes.
