  <h3>Creating a QiType</h3>
  <p>To insert data into Qi, you must first create a QiType that will enforce what type of data is written to a stream.
    For this sample, we will be writing events of the WaveData type discussed in the README.
    Press the button below to create the WaveData QiType.</p>
  <div>
    <button class="btn btn-primary" (click)="createType()">Create Type</button>
    <br>
    <span *ngIf="button1Message">Response: {{button1Message}}</span>
  </div>
  <h3>Creating a QiStream</h3>
  <p>Now that we have a QiType, we can create a QiStream. Once we create a stream and associate it with a type,
  we can write data of that type to Qi. Press the button below to create a stream.</p>
  <button class="btn btn-primary" (click)="createStream()">Create Stream</button>
  <br>
  <span *ngIf="button2Message">Response: {{button2Message}}</span>
  <h3>Write data to Qi</h3>
  <p>Press the button below to write 10 WaveData events to Qi using the InsertValues call.</p>
  <button class="btn btn-primary" (click)="writeWaveDataEvents()">Insert Values</button>
  <br>
  <span *ngIf="button3Message">Response: {{button3Message}}</span>
  <h3>Retrieving events from Qi</h3>
  <p>There are several ways to read data back from Qi. Using GetRangeValues, we can start at index location "1" of our wave data
  and get the remaining events. We didn't actually write a value with an index of 1, but since we use QiBoundaryType.ExactOrCalculated
  in our request, we get an interpolated value at index location 1.</p>
  <button class="btn btn-primary" (click)="retrieveWaveDataEvents()">Retrieve Events</button>
  <br>
  <span *ngIf="button4Message">Response: {{button4Message}}</span>
  <div *ngIf="hasEvents">
    <table class="table table-striped table-responsive">
      <tr>
        <th>Order</th>
        <th>Radians</th>
        <th>Tau</th>
        <th>Sin</th>
        <th>Cos</th>
        <th>Tan</th>
        <th>Sinh</th>
        <th>Cosh</th>
        <th>Tanh</th>
      </tr>
      <tr *ngFor="let event of events">
        <td>{{event.Order}}</td>
        <td>{{event.Radians}}</td>
        <td>{{event.Tau}}</td>
        <td>{{event.Sin}}</td>
        <td>{{event.Cos}}</td>
        <td>{{event.Tan}}</td>
        <td>{{event.Sinh}}</td>
        <td>{{event.Cosh}}</td>
        <td>{{event.Tanh}}</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>
  <h4>Update values</h4>
  <p>A call to update values will either create or replace an event at the associated index location.  We will send a collection of
    twenty events to Qi, causing ten events to be updated and an additionaly ten to be created. Press Retrieve Events above to 
    see the updated data.
  </p>
  <button class="btn btn-primary" (click)="updateWaveDataEvents()" >Update values</button>
  <br>
  <span *ngIf="button14Message">Response: {{button14Message}}</span>

  <h4>Replace values</h4>
  <p>A call to replace values will either create or replace an event at the associated Index location. Press Retrieve Events above to 
    see the replaced data.</p>
  <button class="btn btn-primary" (click)="replaceWaveDataEvents()" >Replace values</button>
  <br>
  <span *ngIf="button15Message">Response: {{button15Message}}</span>
  <h3>Using QiStreamBehaviors</h3>
  <p>The default behavior for a QiStream is Continuous, which will allow interpolation when a requested index
  isn't present. In order to change this to only give us exact values that were written, we can create a
  behavior with Discrete mode and update the stream to use it. Once the stream is updated, we should no longer see a value at 1.</p>
  <button class="btn btn-primary" (click)="createBehaviorAndUpdateStream()" >Create Behavior and Update Stream</button>
  <br>
  <span *ngIf="button5Message">Response: {{button5Message}}</span>
  <h3>Using QiStreamViews</h3>
  <p>QiStreamViews can return a view of the data stored on the server, we can use them to coerce QiStream data of 
    a certain type to be returned as another type. A simple example of this would be to provide a type with the same 
    data shape using different names for each property.</p>
  <button class="btn btn-primary" (click)="createAutoviewTargetType()" >Create a target QiType</button>
  <br>
  <span *ngIf="button6Message">Response: {{button6Message}}</span>
  <p>Once we have created our target type we create a QiView specifying a SourceTypeId (our original QiType) and 
    a TargetTypeId.</p>
  <button class="btn btn-primary" (click)="createAutoview()" >Create a QiView</button>
  <br>
  <span *ngIf="button7Message">Response: {{button7Message}}</span>
  <p>We can now use this QiView on any GET request and our data will be returned with the structure of the target QiType.</p>
    <button class="btn btn-primary" (click)="retrieveWaveDataEventsAutoview()" >Retrieve Events</button>
    <br>
    <span *ngIf="button8Message">Response: {{button8Message}}</span>
    <div *ngIf="hasView1Events">
      <table class="table table-striped table-responsive">
        <tr>
          <th>OrderTarget</th>
          <th>RadiansTarget</th>
          <th>TauTarget</th>
          <th>SinTarget</th>
          <th>CosTarget</th>
          <th>TanTarget</th>
          <th>SinhTarget</th>
          <th>CoshTarget</th>
          <th>TanhTarget</th>
        </tr>
        <tr *ngFor="let event of targetEvents">
          <td>{{event.OrderTarget}}</td>
          <td>{{event.RadiansTarget}}</td>
          <td>{{event.TauTarget}}</td>
          <td>{{event.SinTarget}}</td>
          <td>{{event.CosTarget}}</td>
          <td>{{event.TanTarget}}</td>
          <td>{{event.SinhTarget}}</td>
          <td>{{event.CoshTarget}}</td>
          <td>{{event.TanhTarget}}</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>
  <p>We can also specify target types that have different shapes and data types, in the simple example above Qi 
    was able to perform the mapping automatically.  To make more complex changes we will need to specify the mappings
    explicitly.  For this we add a QiViewProperty mapping the source property to the target property.  We will create 
    three QiViewProperties and return Sin, Cos and Tan as though they were integers.  
  </p>
    <button class="btn btn-primary" (click)="createQiViewPropertiesAndManualType()" >Create QiView with QiViewProperties</button>
    <br>
    <span *ngIf="button9Message">Response: {{button9Message}}</span>
    <p>  Speficying this QiView on our GET request we see that Qi has only returned values for those Properties that have
      an explicit mapping.
      </p>
        <button class="btn btn-primary" (click)="retrieveWaveDataEventsManualview()" >Retrieve Events</button>
        <br>
        <span *ngIf="button10Message">Response: {{button10Message}}</span>
        <div *ngIf="hasView2Events">
            <table class="table table-striped table-condensed">
              <tr>
                <th>OrderTarget</th>
                <th>SinInt</th>
                <th>CosInt</th>
                <th>TanInt</th>
              </tr>
              <tr *ngFor="let event of integerEvents">
                <td>{{event.OrderTarget}}</td>
                <td>{{event.SinhInt}}</td>
                <td>{{event.CoshInt}}</td>
                <td>{{event.TanhInt}}</td>
              </tr>
            </table>
          </div>
        <p>  Finally, if we are ever curious about the mapping for a specific view we can request its QiViewMap.  This will show the relationship 
          between the SourceType and the TargetType.
            </p>
              <button class="btn btn-primary" (click)="getQiViewMap()" >Request QiViewMap</button>

                  <table class="table table-striped table-bordered">

                        <th>TargetPropertyId</th>
                      </tr>
                      <ng-container *ngFor="let prop of viewMap.Properties">

  <h3>Delete Values</h3>
  <p>Press the button below to delete all values from the QiStream, pressing Retrieve Events 
    above should now return an empty array.

  <span *ngIf="button13Message">Response: {{button13Message}}</span>

  <h4>Deleting types, streams, views and behaviors</h4>
  <p>Press the button below to delete the types, streams, views and behaviors that this sample has created. Failure to do
  so could cause conflicts if the sample runs again. Please note that deleting a stream deletes all of the data
  written to that stream.</p>
  <button class="btn btn-primary" (click)="cleanup()">Clean up</button>
