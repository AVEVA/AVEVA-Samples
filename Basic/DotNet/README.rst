.NET Samples
=============

There are two .NET samples, both written in C#.

Sds Client Libraries
-------------------

This sample uses the OSIsoft Sds Client Libraries, which support the full
features of Sds. The sample document is here:
https://github.com/osisoft/OCS-Samples/blob/master/Basic/DotNet/readme_SdsLibs.rst.

Sds REST API
-----------

This sample does not make any use of OSIsoft code. Instead, raw REST
calls are composed and submitted as in the samples for other languages.
This sample is documented here:
https://github.com/osisoft/OCS-Samples/blob/master/Basic/DotNet/readme_REST.rst.
