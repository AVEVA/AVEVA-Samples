#.NET Samples

There are two .NET samples, both written in C#.

##Qi Client Libraries

This sample uses the OSIsoft Qi Client Libraries, which support the full features of Qi.  The sample document is here: <https://github.com/osisoft/Qi-Samples/blob/master/Basic/DotNet/readme_QiLibs.md>.

##Qi REST API

This sample does not make any use of OSIsoft code.  Instead, raw REST calls are composed and submitted as in the samples for other languages.  This sample is documented here: <https://github.com/osisoft/Qi-Samples/blob/master/Basic/DotNet/readme_REST.md>.
