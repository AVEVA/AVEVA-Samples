#.NET Samples

There are two .NET samples, both written in C#.

##QiLIbs

The first uses the OSIsoft Qi Libraries, which support the full features of Qi.  The document is here: <https://github.com/osisoft/Qi-Samples/blob/master/DotNet/readme_QiLibs.md>.

##REST

This is similar to the other samples in that it does not make any use of OSIsoft code.  Instead, raw REST calls are composed and submitted.  The features of this sample are identical to the QiLibs sample. The documents is found here: <https://github.com/osisoft/Qi-Samples/blob/master/DotNet/readme_REST.md>.
