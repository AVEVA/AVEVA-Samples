# Intro

This document is a guide on how to connect to OSISoft Cloud Services (OCS) using
a client of your choice. We will first cover the difference between
authorization (AuthZ) and authentication (AuthN) and how they relate to you as a
developer of OCS. Then we will introduce some possible scenarios using some
GitHub examples.

## Authentication

In the realm of web security, authentication is about proving to a second party
that you are who you say you are. For example, I, as a user (*resource
owner*), use a website (*client*) to authenticate against a backend service
(*authorization server*) so that I can access resources from that same or
another backend service (*resource server*). In other words, before I can check
my mail using a web browser I need to authenticate using my username and
password. After this step is concluded the browser receives a token, which it
then uses on any subsequent request to the backend email server to fetch my
emails. This token will in most cases have an expiration, after which it either
needs to be renewed, using a refresh token or going through the process again,
or it is no longer valid.

## Authorization

Authorization is related to, but not the same as authentication. Authorization
is about proving to a second party that you are allowed to access some
resources on it. This means that you have already proven you are who you
say you are, and have been provided with some sort of token to prove your
identity.

If you are taking a flight, at the gate you show your ticket to prove that you
are authorized to access the flight. You also show a form of identification to
show that you are the person whose name is listed on that ticket; in other
words, you authenticate yourself.

## OCS Authentication and Authorization

OCS uses implementations of [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/)
connect and [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) to handle authentication and
authorization. Our implementation of these protocols relies on third party
*Identity Providers* (e.g., Microsoft Accounts, Azure Active Directory, etc.),
and does not allow user accounts to be created or stored in OCS.

## All the Parties involved

For the rest of this document we will use the following language to refer to
the parties involved during authentication and authorization,

- Resource Owner - This is a typically a user who owns some sort of resource in
  a server. For example, a company employee who has been registered as part of a
  tenant.
- Client - Any software that the *resource owner* uses to access resources. For
  example, a console app used to access data, a web browser, or a native
  application.
- Resource Server - The server that holds some resources, owned by users, which
  they try to access. For example, the OCS Service that hold data for a tenant.
- Authorization Server - The server that generates an Access Token for a client
  once it has been authenticated and given the right permissions by the resource
  owner. In our case this would be the OCS Identity Service.
- IdentityProvider - a third party that creates, maintains, and manages identity
  information for principals while providing authentication services. For
  example, Microsoft Account and Azure Active Directory.

## Other terms

These are some of the terms that you will encounter in this document and other
related OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect literature.

- [JSON Web Token (JWT)](https://jwt.io/introduction/) - A three part, period
  delimited, base 64 encoded string, that contains header, claims, and
  signature. The signature is a cryptographically encrypted version of the body,
  which when possesing the right cryptographic keys, is used to verify the
  authenticity and integrity of the header and claims components. These tokens
  have an expiration time.
- Claims - A list of key value pairs that provide some information about the
  Resource Owner, client, and audience. These claims are base 64 encoded,
  and are used in the backend and frontend to determine the user and the tenant
  it belongs to among other things.
- Access Token - The JWT that results from a successful authentication process,
  and contains some predefined fields. This is sent as part of the Authorization
  header with all the following requests in the session.
- Refresh Token - A token used to get a new Access Token after the current one
  expires, without having to go through the authentication process again. Usually
  has a long expiration date.

## OCS Supported Authenticated Flows

Currently OCS supports a number of authentication flows. Based on your
requirements choose the one that best fits your needs. The following
subsections are more technical and implementation oriented than the first part
of the document.

### Client Credential Flow

If you are writing software (client) to communicate with OCS without the presence
of a user, then this is authentication flow you should follow. This flow was
created for machine to machine communication.

A client is any software that a resource owner uses to access his resources on a
remote server. In this case the client itself is the resource owner, and there
is no actual user to perform the authentication process. The client uses his
Client Id and Client Secret to authenitcate against OCS and is awarded an Access
Token. It is assumed that the client stores the Client Secret in a safe
location, and uses cryptographically secure channels -read https- to communicate
with OCS. OCS only support communication over https. No Refresh Token is
awarded.

The sample for this authentication flow can be found
[here](./DotNet/ClientCredentialFlow/ ).

### Implicit Flow

If you are developing any Javascript/Browser based applications, with the
user (resource owner) trying to access resources this should be your
authentication method of choice.

In this case the user will have to authenticate against the identity provider
and an Access Token will be provided to the client. A certain level of trust on
the client/browser is expected. No Refresh Token provided.

The sample for this authentication flow can be found [here](./DotNet/ImplicitFlow/).

### Hybrid Flow

If you are developing a traditional thick applications, with the
user trying to access resources this should be your authentication method of
choice. This flow provides a more secure means of authenticating, but also has
the most constraining requirements. In this case the user will authenticate
against the identity provider using any type of browser, even an unsafe one.
Once this is completed the server-side client will authenticate against the
authorization server and be awarded an Access Token and a Refresh Token, which
should never be displayed to the user or the browser.

The sample for this authentication flow can be found [here](./DotNet/HybridFlow/).
