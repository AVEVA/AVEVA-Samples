.NET Samples
=============

There are two .NET samples, both written in C#.

SDS Client Libraries
-------------------

This sample uses the OSIsoft SDS Client Libraries, which support the full
features of SDS. The sample document is here:
https://github.com/osisoft/OCS-Samples/blob/master/basic_samples/SDS/DotNet/readme_SdsLibs.rst.

SDS REST API
-----------

This sample does not make any use of OSIsoft code. Instead, raw REST
calls are composed and submitted as in the samples for other languages.
This sample is documented here:
https://github.com/osisoft/OCS-Samples/blob/master/basic_samples/SDS/DotNet/readme_REST.rst.
