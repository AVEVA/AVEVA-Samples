The sample code in the folders below demonstrate how to invoke Dataview REST APIs via the sample client libraries. 
The steps performed in the examples are similar and follow this general flow: 

1) Authenticating into OCS
2) Creating Types, Streams, and data (as needed)
3) Creating a dataview
4) Retreiving the dataview
5) Updating the dataview
6) Retreiving the updated dataview
7) Getting all created dataviews
8) Getting the datagroup of the created dataview
9) Check the preview data
10) Check the interpolated data using sessions
11) Recheck the preview data (should be different then 9
12) Recheck interpolated data using the previous session (should be the same as 10)
13) Delete every that was created
