# Welcome to the testing guide!


For OCS Samples testing we are concerned with testing the samples to ensure that each sample works completely and as expected with no errors.  We check final and intermittant results in the samples to ensure the results are as expected.  The goal for the tests is to ensure a level of confidence of operation in each sample, that the sample is working and running as expected, so that a user of a sample knows they have a good starting base to learn from.
