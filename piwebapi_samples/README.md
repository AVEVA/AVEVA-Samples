# PI Web API Samples

There are three types of samples/apps in the repo:

* <img src="../miscellaneous/images/app-type-getting-started.png" alt="getting-started icon">  Getting Started - OCS focused samples for a task, usually implemented as a simple console app.  This also includes base libraries that may be used in other apps.

* <img src="../miscellaneous/images/app-type-ingress.png" alt="ingress icon">   Ingress apps - Real world examples of applications focused on sending data to OCS.  

* <img src="../miscellaneous/images/app-type-e2e.png" alt="e2e icon">   End-End apps - Real world examples of web, desktop, mobile, and other applications using OCS data.  

Some tasks and individual language examples may have some additional labels as follows:

The official PI Web API samples are divided in multiple categories depending on the scenario and problem/task, accessible through the following table:

Task|Description|Languages|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Test&nbsp;Status&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
----|-----------|---------|-----------

## Credentials 

A credential config.ini or app.config file is used in the examples unless otherwise noted in the example.  
   

     Note: This is not a secure way to store credentials.  This is to be used at your own risk.  
   
   
   You will need to modify these files locally when you run the samples.

## Request for example 

Please raise an issue if you would like to see a new task, a new example inside of a task, or an existing example in a particular langauge.
