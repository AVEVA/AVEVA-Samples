Building a .NET client to send OMF to PI or OCS
==================================================================

The sample code in this topic demonstrates how to send OMF messages
using Python. 

The samples were built and tested against Python 3.  If you are using 
a different version you might encounter errors or unexepected behavior.    
	
To Run this Sample:
-------------------
1. Clone the GitHub repository
2. Install required modules: ``pip install -r requirements.txt``
3. Open the folder with your favorite IDE
4. Update ``config.ini`` with the credentials provided by OSIsoft
5. Check and update the program to ensure you are sending to OCS or PI.  
6. Run ``program.py``
