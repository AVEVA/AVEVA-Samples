# Welcome!

If you are here, it means you are interested in helping.  Thanks!  There are many ways you can contribute to the OCS Samples:

* Offer Pull Requests to fix issues or improve the samples.
* Give us feedback and bug reports regarding the samples or the documentation.
* Create a new sample.

All pull requests and issues will be reviewed by the team.

## New Samples Checklist:
* Clear Task Name
* General Readme
* Language Specific Readme (Can be in general readme if there is only 1 language.  This should be easily seperated out of the general readme in case another language is added late.r)
* Tests (See [sample testing guide](test_guide.md) for details.)
